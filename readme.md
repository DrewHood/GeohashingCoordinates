## Geohashing Coordinate Calculator

This Lumen implementation avails an API to calculate the coordinate offset based on string input, per the [xkcd Geohashing Algorithm](http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/The_Algorithm). It only implements the hashing portion of the algorithm. Client devices are expected to retrieve the proper Dow Jones opening value and format the string with the date, as per [the spec](http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/File:Coordinates.png).
